--- Xref-service Help ---

The command "xref service" outputs the cross-references of services on
  an equipment.

xref service [fmt formatstring] [proto (TCP|UDP) [from|to|other] [service_port]

service_port specifies the services to output. It can be a service name or a
  range of ports using the first port and the last port of the
  range between parenthesis: (first,last). Spaces are not allowed in this
  notation.

fmt formatstring allows to specify the output using format tags. The formatstring
should be quoted by " :

  %c context name.
  %C context comment.
  %e equipment name.
  %f filename of the context (without path).
  %F filename of the context (with path).
  %h hostname (using PTR like 'p').
  %H hostname (using DNS resolver like 'h').
  %i address ip (in short form as ::1).
  %I address ip (in long form).
  %l line short (first line of configuration).
  %L line long (all the lines of configuration).
  %N line number of the context.
  %p the protocols of this service.
  %r port range of this service.
  %t the type of this reference (FROM/TO/OTHER).

proto (TCP|UDP) allows to filter on the service's protocols.

from|to|other allows to filter on the service's type. The service's type
  specifies where the service is used:
    - from: as a source service
    - to: as a destination service
    - other: other usages.

examples:
---------

Output references of the service tcp/ssh
  xref service proto tcp ssh

output references for "source" service range 22..1024
xref service from (ssh,1024)

Note:
-----
This command is only available on some equipments via the "equipment"
  command of lsfw.

Example with a PacketFilter equipment named "PF":
  lsfw> equipment PF xref service
