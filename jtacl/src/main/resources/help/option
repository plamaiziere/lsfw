option | o [option-name = value] : Displays or sets lsfw options.

  Without parameter, option displays the current value of each option.

lsfw defines the options.
  - autoreload
  - config.level
  - crossreference
  - debug.level
  - dns.cache.ttl
  - maxhop
  - notify.level
  - securelevel

* option autoreload <boolean>
If true, lsfw will reload the configuration of an equipment if a configuration
file of this equipment has changed. The topology is also rebuilt.

Possible values for logger option are (from less to high):

* option maxhop <integer>:
  The maximum number of probing. This number is decremented each time a probing
