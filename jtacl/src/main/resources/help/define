--- define ---
define | d [name = value] : define a variable that can be used as a macro.

  Without parameter, 'define' displays all the current defined variables.
define name = value allows to define a new variable named 'name' with the
value 'value'

  Variables can be used as a macro on the command line preceded by a '$'.

  Variables can be defined in the main jtacl configuration file using the XML
entity 'define':
<define name="name" value="value" />

  The 'DFLTEQUIPMENT' variable, if defined, is used as the default equipment
specification in the probe command (see probe command).

Example:
--------

jtacl> define EXTERN = equipment|interface
jtacl> define
EXTERN=equipment|interface
jtacl> p on $EXTERN 1.2.3.4 192.168.0.1

Or, to define the variable for each session:
jtacl.xml
<define name="EXTERN" value="equipment|interface" />
