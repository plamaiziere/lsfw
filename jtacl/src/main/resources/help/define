--- define ---
define | d [name = value] : Defines a variable which can be used as a macro.

  Without parameter, 'define' displays all the current defined variables.
define name = value allows to define a new variable named 'name' with the
value 'value'

  Variables can be used as a macro on the command line preceded by a '$'.

  Variables can be defined in the main jtacl configuration file using the
<define> XML entity:
<define name="name" value="value" />

  The 'DFLTEQUIPMENT' variable, if defined, is used as the default equipment
specification in the probe command (see probe command) for IPv4.

  The 'DFLTEQUIPMENT6' variable, if defined, is used as the default equipment
specification in the probe command (see probe command) for IPv6.

Example:
--------

jtacl> define EXTERN = equipment|interface
jtacl> define
EXTERN=equipment|interface
jtacl> p on $EXTERN 1.2.3.4 192.168.0.1

Or to define the variable for each session:
jtacl.xml
<define name="EXTERN" value="equipment|interface" />
