xref ip [(format formatstring)|(fmt formatstring)] [host] [IpAddress]: Outputs the cross-reference
  of IP addresses on an equipment.

IPAddress specifies the IP to output. Any IP overlapping this IPAddress are
  displayed. If "host" is specified, only references to this host ip address are
  displayed.

format formatstring allows to specify the output format by a combinaison
  of letters:

  h: (hostname) outputs the hostname of IP addresses, doing a revert DNS
        request.
  p: (PTR) outputs the hostname, doing a PTR revert DNS request. This is faster
        than 'h'.
  l: (long) ouptuts all the lines of configuration.
  s: (short) outputs only the first line of configuration.

fmt formatstring allows to specify the output using format tags. The formatstring
should be quoted by " :

  %c context name.
  %C context comment.
  %e equipment name.
  %f filename of the context (without path).
  %F filename of the context (with path).
  %h hostname (using PTR like 'p').
  %H hostname (using DNS resolver like 'h').
  %i address ip (in short form as ::1).
  %I address ip (in long form).
  %l line short (first line of configuration).
  %L line long (all the lines of configuration).
  %N line number of the context.
