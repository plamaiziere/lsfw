xref ip [format formatstring] [host] [IpAddress]: Outputs the cross-reference
  of IP addresses on an equipment.

IPAddress specifies the IP to output. Any IP overlapping this IPAddress are
  displayed. If "host" is specified, only references to this host ip address are
  displayed.

format formatstring allows to specify the output format by a combinaison
  of letters:

  h: (hostname) outputs the hostname of IP addresses, doing a revert DNS
        request.
  p: (PTR) outputs the hostname, doing a PTR revert DNS request. This is faster
        than 'h'.
  l: (long) ouptuts all the lines of configuration.
  s: (short) outputs only the first line of configuration.


examples:
---------

xref ip
xref ip format s
xref ip format sh host 192.168.1.0/24

Note:
-----
This command is only available on some equipments via the "equipment"
  command of lsfw.

Example with a PacketFilter equipment named "PF":
  lsfw> equipment PF xref ip format s
