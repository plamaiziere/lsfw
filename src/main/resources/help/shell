--- builtin shell ---

The builtin shell allows to 'tee' the output of a command to a file. A tee is
specified by the string '|>' or '|>>', followed by a filename.

 |> filename : override the file.
 |>> filename : append to the file.

Examples:
--------
  lsfw> topology |> topology.txt
  lsfw> topology |>> topology.txt
